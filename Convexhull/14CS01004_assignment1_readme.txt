Code usage:

Input:-

1) First make a list of the total points(aside) and enter the no.of vertices of the convex polygon.
2) Now enter the indexes(Position) of the vertices in clockwise order.
    
	Eg: (1,1),(2,2),(2,1)....... are the vertices then if (2,2) is vertex of convex polygon the index(Position) = 2
	
3)Now enter the total number of vertices 
4)Enter the vertices (all)


Output:-

1)The sorted list of remaining points which participate in the convex hull finding 

2)Convex hull vertices ( Final result )
